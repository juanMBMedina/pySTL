pySTL
=====

Python code for working with .STL (sterolithography) files.  

Often, STL files are exported from modelling software in awkward locations or with strange bounding boxes.  It can be useful to move them around and rotate them without having to open with modelling software again.  This is a simple library that can read, write and do basic manipulations of STL files.  

Currently can be given inputs of ASCII or binary STL and outputs ASCII STL.  ASCII inputs are better tested.
